# HotDogOrNotHotDog

#### What do Fox News and CNN have in common? Well Fox News can't tell the difference between a hot dog or not a hot dog.
Well, one is a news channel and the other is my next project! Say hello to my CNN inspired by Silicon Valley's smashing app. In addition to my commits to learning C and front end, I'm going to also be working on my next machine learning project. A new realm to me, deep learning will help me take a new approach to machine learning. My mind wonders at the possibilities that CNN's can be applied to and I'm excited to work on this project and get it running. I'm going to test a weiner dog in a hot dog costume and see what the results of CNN say! Stay tuned! 

#### Goals

1. Build my own CNN to classify hot dog or not hot dog 
2. Transfer Learn my image repository to Google's Inception
3. Eat a hot dog and have fun!
